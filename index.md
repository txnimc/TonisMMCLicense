# Toni's Modded Minecraft License

In short, this license is intended to be mostly open source with a few protections for mod authors. If you just want to use this as a dependency for something, go ahead! If you want to fork it, please read:

## Can I use this in my modpacks?

Yes, of course! you can use this mod in your modpack without asking, as long as it's downloaded from the official Curseforge or Modrinth link.

## Can I fork this mod?

Yes, however, you must split 50% of the revenue with the original author. You may not relicense the software. You may not reupload it to other sites besides Curseforge or Modrinth.

## Can I use this as a separate dependency for my own mods?

You can compile against this mod and use it as a library, but you may not JIJ it or bundle it with your mod. It should be marked as a dependency on Curseforge or Modrinth.

## Can I copy this bit of code I saw?

Yes! Just be respectful. You may copy small parts of this mod, such as individual functions and the build script, if used in another mod with different functionality. You may not copy a substantial amount of the mod, or copy code from this mod to use in competing mods that serve a similar purpose.

If you're confused about any of this, you should ask me directly.

You may use this mod freely in modpacks, and you may edit and fork this mod under a few conditions:

- You may not reupload this mod to other mod hosting sites that do not pay authors, such as PlanetMinecraft.
